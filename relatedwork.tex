%%In ~\cite{Zhang:2017}, a self-adaptive distributed decision support model for IoT applications is proposed. The model has been designed using an artificial neural network (ANN) for environment recognition, a knowledge merging to create a local knowledge base and an expert systems for decision making that finally provide intelligent support for IoT applications. However, the proposed model does not deal with conflict of interests of system components at runtime.
